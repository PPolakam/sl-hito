# sl-hito

Much like [kaiwa](https://github.com/PPolakam/sl-kaiwa "会話"), hito is a template project meant to give me a starting point to use whenever I am working on a project that demands similar functionality. As the name kind of implies,
hito is designed to work with kaiwa to make a pretty basic chat app.

One objective with these template projects is that I will be using languages and tools that I'm still learning. While kaiwa was a kotlin/springboot project, hito will be a kotlin + htmx project (anything beyond that seems overkill for 
this).

_As a side note, the name "hito" comes from the Japanese "人", meaning "person". (people have conversations, 人々が会話できる)_
